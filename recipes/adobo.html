    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <div class="para1">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the vegetable in a large skillet or heavy-bottomed pot over
          medium heat. Add chicken pieces to pot in a single layer with the skin
          side down. Cook each piece of chicken for about 6-7 minutes. Use tongs
          to flip the chicken pieces and cook until lightly brown, about 3
          minutes, then flip. Place cooked chicken on a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          Add the garlic, onions, and bay leaves into the pot, cook until they
          soften and brown, about 6 minutes. Add water to the mixture and and
          scrape any brown bits left on the bottom and sides of the pan.
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          Return the cooked chicken back into the pot. Add your soy sauce and
          vinegar, along with the garlic powder and black pepper, and set to
          high heat to bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover,and
          simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through. This will take
          about <strong>30 minutes</strong>.
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>To Serve:</strong> The chicken is best serverd with a side of

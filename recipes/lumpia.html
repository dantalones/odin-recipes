    <h2>What is Lumpia?</h2>

    <p>
      Pronounced <em>(loom-pee-uh)</em>, is a Filipino style, deep-fried
      appetizer which houses a variety of filling wrapped in a thin egg crepe.
      Fillings can range from a looming variety of vegetables, to an assortment
      of meats. Lumpia is normally served with a side of sweet and sour sauce,
      which helps to compliment the spring roll. Check out how to make them

    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a wok or a large skillet over high heat, add your 1 tablespoons of
        vegetable oil. Add your choice of<br />meat, cook throughly depending on
        internal temperature**, and set aside to rest. Drain the grease from
        the<br />pan,leaving a thin coating to cook the garlic and onions for 2
        minutes. Add your cooked meat, carrots, green<br />onions, and cabbage
        to the same pan. Season with salt and pepper, garlic powder, and soy
        sauce. Remove<br />pan from heat and set aside to cool.<br />
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Place three heaping tablespoons of the filling diagonally near one
        corner of each lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1&frac12;"<br />
        space at both ends. Fold the side aling the length of the filling, tuck
        in both ends, and roll neatly. Keep the roll<br />tight as you assemble.
        Moisten the other side of the wrapper with waterto seal the edge. Repeat
        with you desired<br />serving count. Cover each roll with saran warp to
        retain moisture.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to about &frac12;" depth,
        and heat for 5 minutes. Slide three or four<br />
        lumpia into the oil. Fry the rolls for<em> 1 to 2 minutes</em>, until
        all sides are golden brown. Drain cooked rolls on a<br />
        paper towel. Best served right out of the pan!

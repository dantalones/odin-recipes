This is dantalones first HTML project. This project will demosntrate how
to create a recipes webpage using what what I have learned from
The Odin Projects HTML Foundations from unordered // ordered lists, to absolute and relative links. Click the <a href="https://dantalones.github.io/odin-recipes/">link</a> for a live preview!

Any constructive feedback is much appreciated. Thanks everyone!

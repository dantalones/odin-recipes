    <p>Awesome picture, right? That is called a <em>Kamayan Feast</em>, a Filipino, communal style buffet with endless kinds of delicious Filipino foods <br> piled onto a plate of banana leaves. Kamayan means <strong>hand</strong> and as you can tell, everything
        is eaten by hand.

        <p>Below are the most common / popular Filipino dishes, and I want to show you how to make them. Clink on each food to find out!</p>
